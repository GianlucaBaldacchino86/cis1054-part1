# cis1054-part1
In order to setup a HTTP server in order to test php files, XAMPP was dowloaded and setup.
The php files found in the cis1054-part1 were copy and pasted inside the htdocs folder found in the XAMPP directory.
Then in the XAMPP control pannel the start button next to the Apache module was pressed in order to start the HTTP server.
After that inside the web browser the following address was placed in the search bar:   
http://localhost/cis1054-part1/index.php
This opens the index.php file which contains all the other php files being used.
